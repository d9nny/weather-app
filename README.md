# WeatherDashboard

## Brief

A client requires a simple web application that will enable their analysts to understand the weather in a specific location in the world ðŸŒŽ.

Your brief is to create a single page web application that will allow the user to enter a location and view weather details about it. The client would like to see the following details in particular:

- Current temperature
- Current weather conditions
- Time till next sunset
- Chart showing the forecast (min, max and average temperature) for the next six days including today.

If you feel up to it (stretch goal), the client would also like to see the current search location pinned on a map.

## Installation

Run 'npm install' to install the dependencies.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


## To do:

- Finish unit tests
- Show location
